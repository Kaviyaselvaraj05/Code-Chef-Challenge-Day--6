02)Just One More Episode
Chef has to attend an exam that starts in 
𝑋
X minutes, but of course, watching shows takes priority.

Every episode of the show that Chef is watching, is 
24
24 minutes long.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
𝑇
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of one line of input, containing a single integer 
𝑋
X — the amount of time from now at which Chef's exam starts.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the answer — YES if Chef will finish his episode before the exam starts, and NO otherwise.

Each character of the output may be printed in either lowercase or uppercase, i.e, the string Yes, YES, yes, YeS` will all be treated as equivalent.

60
60 minutes of free time, which is easily enough to finish watching a 
24
24-minute episode. Hence, the answer is Yes.

Test case 
4
4: Chef has 
24
24 minutes of free time. He will finish watching the episode exactly when the exam starts, and not strictly before it. Hence, the answer is No.

03)Mana Points
Chef is playing a mobile game. In the game, Chef's character Chefario can perform special attacks. However, one special attack costs

If Chefario currently has 
𝑌
Y mana points, determine the maximum number of special attacks he can perform.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer 
𝑇
T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers

04)Rain in Chefland
In Chefland, precipitation is measured using a rain gauge in millimetre per hour.

Chef categorises rainfall as:

LIGHT, if rainfall is less than 
3
3 millimetre per hour.
MODERATE, if rainfall is greater than equal to 
3
3 millimetre per hour and less than 
7
7 millimetre per hour.
HEAVY if rainfall is greater than equal to 
7
7 millimetre per hour.
Given that it rains at 
𝑋
X millimetre per hour on a day, find whether the rain is LIGHT, MODERATE, or HEAVY.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
𝑇
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single integer 
𝑋
X — the rate of rainfall in millimetre per hour.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, whether the rain is LIGHT, MODERATE, or HEAVY.
